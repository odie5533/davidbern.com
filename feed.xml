Below, we generate a few examples of such diagrams using languages such as <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/" target="\_blank">mermaid</a>, <a href="https://plantuml.com/" target="\_blank">plantuml</a>, <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/" target="\_blank">vega-lite</a>, etc.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> different diagram-generation packages require external dependencies to be installed on your machine. Also, be mindful of that because of diagram generation the fist time you build your Jekyll website after adding new diagrams will be SLOW.

You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="citations">Citations</h2> <p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag. The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography. The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.</p> <p>The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote></p> <hr/> <h2 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h2> <p>Syntax highlighting is provided within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> tags. An example of inline code snippets: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code language="html"&gt;let x = 10;&lt;/d-code&gt;</code>. For larger blocks of code, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block</code> attribute:</p> <d-code block="" language="javascript"> var x = 25; function(x) { return x * x; } </d-code> <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> blocks do not look good in the dark mode. You can always use the default code-highlight using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlight</code> liquid tag:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure> <hr/> <h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2> <p>The main text column is referred to as the body. It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d-article</code> element.</p> <div class="fake-img l-body"> <p>.l-body</p> </div> <p>For images you want to display a little larger, try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-page</code>:</p> <div class="fake-img l-page"> <p>.l-page</p> </div> <p>All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit. For instance:</p> <div class="fake-img l-body-outset"> <p>.l-body-outset</p> </div> <div class="fake-img l-page-outset"> <p>.l-page-outset</p> </div> <p>Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width. For this, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-screen</code>. You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.</p> <div class="fake-img l-screen"> <p>.l-screen</p> </div> <div class="fake-img l-screen-inset"> <p>.l-screen-inset</p> </div> <p>The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.

Disclaimer: I do not think I was able to answer the leading question of this essay sufficiently, as it undoubtedly is a very difficult one. Anyway, as always, here goes.</p> <hr/> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>The field of psychology first emerged as a branch of philosophy, and it continued to remain so until the middle of the 19th century (cf. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118133880.hop201003" target="_blank">Fuchs &amp; Evans, 2013</a>, pp. 4–5). Psychology has since drastically gained in importance as the scientific discipline that inquires human behaviour and thought, and yet, institutions and scholars are not in agreement on whether and how psychology should be categorized as a scientific discipline. Such can be seen on how some universities lead their institute of psychology under the umbrella of the natural sciences (e.g., <a href="https://www.psychology.hu-berlin.de/en/portal-page?set_language=en" target="_blank">HU Berlin</a>), while others lead it under the faculty of philosophy and humanities (e.g., <a href="https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank">University of Zurich</a>). In the following essay, I argue that while the discipline of psychology as a whole should be categorized as a social science, its subfields such as experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology should be judged independently. Key arguments of select scholars on what broadly defines the natural and social sciences and in what way psychology fits either of the two are discussed.</p> <h2>History, Present, and Future</h2> <p>In his letter to Raumer dated back to 1816, Hegel wrote: “The concrete [universal] divides into natural philosophy, which gives only part of the whole, and the philosophy of spirit, which comprises — beyond psychology along with anthropology and the teaching of law [Recht] and duties — aesthetics and the philosophy of religion” (<a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2590251" target="_blank">p. 341</a>). Since then, psychology has long emancipated itself from the philosophy of spirit, first launching with the aim of becoming an independent scientific discipline. However, this happened not without resistance, Kant being one of various well-respected scholars reluctant to accept this change in affairs:</p> <blockquote> An empirical psychology of mental content could not … become a proper natural science because mental events cannot be quantified (i.e., measured or weighed), and thus its data are neither capable of being described mathematically nor subject to experimental manipulation. Finally, Kant asserted, the method of observing the mind — introspection — distorts the events observed by observing them.” (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118133880.hop201003" target="_blank">Fuchs &amp; Evans, 2013</a>, p.3) </blockquote> <p>After Wilhelm Wundt’s opening of what is known as the first experimental psychology laboratory in 1879, psychology slowly strengthened its status as an experimental scientific discipline (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118133880.hop201003" target="_blank">Fuchs &amp; Evans</a>, 2013, p. 1). While an array of events contributed to this, I would like to mention two in particular: First of all, Wundt, among other things, focused on measuring reaction time as an indicator for the duration of mental processes, demonstrating that introspection was not the only tool fit for studying aspects of human psychology — time, no matter whether on a millisecond timescale, was accepted to be a quantifiable measure through timekeeping (“History of timekeeping devices”, in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_timekeeping_devices&amp;oldid=1007798923" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></em>, n.d.). Secondly, with the addition of Galton’s and Pearson’s statistical methods towards the end of the 19th century, which were explicitly created for analytical purposes such as comparing groups of individuals (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118133880.hop201003" target="_blank">Fuchs &amp; Evans</a>, 2013, pp. 10–11), Kant’s originally valid points of criticism — failure to mathematically describe, quantify and experimentally manipulate — were now negligible. Nevertheless, psychology lacking objectivity due to the observer distorting the observation proved to be a more persistent notion — in fact, until today, it is believed to be one of the key distinctions between the social and natural sciences. Accordingly, many scholars have made arguments in regard to this distinction, of which I would like to discuss two, the first being posited by Jerome Kagan:</p> <blockquote> Most natural scientists hold a condescending view toward social scientists whose evidence is based on human judgments, for example, judges’ ratings of the meaning of a behaviour or a verbal report. But, as noted earlier, particle physicists often rely on the consensual judgments of experts poring over the evidence produced by a linear accelerator. Thus, the nineteenth-century distinction between objectively and subjectively based evidence has become somewhat fuzzier in modern physics laboratories. Each recording device, whether a human or a machine, registers different information, and the evidence from either device often requires consensual agreement among experts to determine meaning and validity. (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/three-cultures/B0B2BBB8B7254D189C67C0227864E1F4" target="_blank">Kagan, 2009</a>, p. 82) </blockquote> <p>So, even if an “objective” entity (e.g., a machine) gathers the data, any one of the steps that follow will inevitably involve human beings, since evaluated data still needs to be interpreted, for which — to my knowledge — there exists no machine yet. Needless to say, it is those same human beings doing the interpreting which inevitably come with flawed human judgment, which in turn makes up the “subjectivity” the natural sciences seek to avoid.</p> <p>There is an important premise that needs to be pointed out here: In his essay <em>Die Logik der Sozialwissenschaften</em>, the academic and philosopher Karl Popper argues why it is misled to assume that objectivity of science relies on the objectivity of the operating scientist. In the eleventh of the text’s 27 theses, he mentions that the natural scientist is just as partial in favouring his own ideas and theories as all other human beings: Some of the most excellent contemporary physicists have founded schools of thought that are explicitly geared towards opposing any new ideas. Popper follows up with what is his twelfth thesis, where he notes that what is considered scientific objectivity lies solely in the tradition of criticism, and that it is this tradition which allows for the prevailing dogma to be criticized against all resistance. In other words, the objectivity of science is not an individual matter, but rather a matter of mutual criticism — the act of scientists distributing the work, keeping each other on their toes, ultimately working together and against each other at the same time (<a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11577-017-0425-6" target="_blank">“Die Logik der Sozialwissenschaften”</a>, 2017, p. 221).</p> <p>However, for the sake of argument, let’s consider Popper’s claim inadmissible, and assume that objectivity of measurement is indeed only founded in the operating scientist, respectively the tool at hand — this would require for the discipline of psychology to be in possession of a tool that is the equivalent of the linear accelerator from physics, like Kagan mentions. We are in luck: Roughly two decades ago, around the turn of the millennium, the methods of neuroimaging achieved a massive breakthrough. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided a novel way of capturing changes in blood flow in the brain, and so cognitive abilities could be directly observed from a perspective never seen before: Instead of having to heavily rely on surface-level phenomena such as visible emotion or physical response, there was now a refined way of gathering data on what happens beneath the surface during those same processes (“Functional magnetic resonance imaging”, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging&amp;oldid=1008966690" target="_blank">in <em>Wikipedia</em></a>, n.d.). Not only did these methods prove to be useful in various disciplines like psychology and medicine, but with its biophysical basis, experts from the natural sciences — especially physicists — were now much needed in associated scientific projects and studies, leading up to much interdisciplinary collaboration.</p> <p>Besides further blurring the line between psychology as a social science and the “higher” standards of natural sciences, this recent development underlines another point: Psychology can hardly be seen as a unified, homogenous field anymore. As an academic discipline, it encompasses a vast range of subfields, from neurocognitive psychology and psychophysics to social psychology and media psychology. As human behaviour and thought by definition is embedded in anything that involves humans, psychology as an applied practice also picks up on many facets of human society such as delinquency (criminal psychology), work (industrial and organizational psychology) and mental health (clinical psychology and psychotherapy). This begs the question: Is it even warranted to judge psychology as an entire discipline anymore?</p> <p>On this note, I would like to go into two more scholars’ views. Professor Billman-Mahecha, a scholar of psychology, argues that “methods do not serve to unify the psychological discipline”. According to her, methodological questions seem to have become a matter of identity, holding more weight than the underlying theoretical positions and the kind of questions that are inquired in the field. In the 20th century, a divide was sparked, a tug of war between <em>natural sciences</em> and <em>humanities</em>, <em>objectivity</em> and <em>subjectivity</em>, <em>nomothetic</em> and <em>idiographic</em>, and most recently, <em>quantitative</em> and <em>qualitative</em>. She notes that while psychology has developed a few notable methods of its own such as <em>test theory</em> in psychometrics, most of them have been adopted and adapted from other fields, concluding that the further methodological development of psychology will not contribute to its unity in any way (<a href="https://www.zpid.de/pub/psychologie-und-geschichte/0935-0179.2001.9_3-4_117-127.pdf" target="_blank">Billmann-Mahecha</a>, n.d., p. 124). Thus, the answer in how the field should be categorized must lie elsewhere.</p> <p>Fortunately, in the same text previously cited in this essay, Popper also dissolves some of this tension, providing a convincing argument as to why it makes sense to categorize psychology as a social science: Human thinking and behaviour largely depends on social context — for example, a) imitation, b) language, and c) family are all social categories, as they rely on a) another being providing a basis for imitation, b) another being being there to converse with and c) a group of beings existing for them to be able to stand in relation to each other. According to Popper, it is clear that the psychology of learning and thinking, but also psychoanalysis, would be impossible without any one of the aforementioned: For example, a readily available opposite is vastly important to learning and thinking (e.g., <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fbff/9f3387db16ae3a5776655885c6a25ea2ffff.pdf" target="_blank">Dautenhahn &amp; Nehaniv</a>, 2007), and psychoanalysis necessitates the client expressing their thoughts in language. This means that psychology presupposes societal terms, and it logically follows that it is impossible for psychology to completely explain society and its phenomena on its own. Now, what represents the study of society are the social sciences, but as we just established, psychology cannot be seen as the fundamental science of it — the social sciences do not rely on psychology. On the other hand, however, psychology <em>does</em> depend on the social sciences: The social categories that it presupposes are founded in concepts of the social sciences, and so the social sciences must be fundamental to psychology.</p> <p>Consequently, I propose that in universities and academia, institutes of psychology and the field as a whole should be led under the umbrella of the social sciences. In light of the vast range of psychology subfields and the ongoing methodological divide, each subfield in question should however be judged on its respective employed methods and theoretical foundations: For example, while the cognitive neurosciences — with methods such as fMRI — adhere to the principles and standards of the natural sciences, social psychology with its use of qualitative tools and strong societal orientation is more in tune with the study of the social sciences.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Both the history and present of psychology are characterized by a lack of clear belonging and unity. The field started out as a branch of philosophy and weathered the storm of criticism from scholars such as Darwin, finding ways of quantifying as well as experimentally manipulating human thought and behaviour. As it evolved into an independent experimental discipline, the standard of objectivity remained hard to live up to, but Popper’s questioning of the concept of objectivity as well as recent methodological advances in neuroimaging methods increasingly blur the line — what is left is the question of what the underlying difference between the natural and social sciences as a whole really is. While psychology ended up being a multi-faceted study encompassing many applied and theoretical branches, its foundation presupposes concepts from the social sciences, while the social sciences do not presuppose concepts from psychology. Thus, psychology can indeed be categorized as part of the social sciences, although this does not necessarily warrant categorizing all of its subfields as social sciences. Lastly, it is likely that the existing divide in the theoretical framework and methodology within the field will persist, which is something to keep in mind for further works on this matter.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="HigherEducation"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had written the following text as a graded essay for a philosophy class I took during my time at HU Berlin, thus the rather formal structure and content.

In case you’re hearing about it for the very first time right now, what comes to mind for you? What do you envision the field to be about? Hold that thought!</p> <p>I still remember what <em>I</em> thought back then: Just like with many other disciplines — think <a href="" target="_blank">Cognitive Neuroscience</a> or <a href="" target="_blank">Computational Sciences</a> — , the name does not feel entirely telling as to what it’s actually about. Fast forward maybe a year or so, and it just so happens that three weeks from now, I’ll be starting a research internship at <a href="" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>’s Professorship for Learning Sciences and Higher Education (<a href="" target="_blank">LSE</a>). I only just recently realized this odd sequence of events, and then another thought crossed my mind: Do I feel like I <em>now</em> know what the Learning Sciences are? Well, let’s put it to the test!</p> <h2>The Background of the Learning Sciences</h2> <p>Admittedly, I already somewhat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)" target="_blank">primed</a> you: I mentioned the words “field”, “disciplines”, “research”, “professorship”, and “education”. And you’ve <em>learned</em> things before, obviously. But what do you see before you when you think of learning? University? Music school? Online courses? Documentaries? Workshops? Driving school?</p> <p>Let’s start with a dry definition and then go from there:</p> <blockquote> The learning sciences is an interdisciplinary field that studies teaching and learning. Learning scientists study a variety of settings, including not only the formal learning of school classrooms, but also the informal learning that takes place at home, on the job, and among peers. The goal of the learning sciences is to better understand the cognitive and social processes that result in the most effective learning and to use this knowledge to redesign classrooms and other learning environments so that people learn more deeply and more effectively. The sciences of learning include cognitive science, educational psychology, computer science, anthropology, sociology, information sciences, neurosciences, education, design studies, instructional design, and other fields. (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-the-learning-sciences/2E4224681267E61DBCE9B27630ED17BA" target="_blank">Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences</a>, p. 37) </blockquote> <p>Now, as we’d like to make sense of it all, I think you’d agree that textbook definitions are a rather boring and ineffective way of doing so. And we wouldn’t want to be <em>ineffective</em> in learning about effective learning, would we? So, instead, we’ll first go back in time — but not just one year, and not just ten years either. One hundred is more like it!</p> <p>Schools at the beginning of the 20th century followed something called <em>instructionism</em>, and people had little to no idea about how humans actually learn things. If they had ideas, they were nothing more than untested hypotheses — there was no such thing as scientifically investigating various teaching styles, classroom settings or school curricula, let alone how informal learning occurs in places such as museums or libraries.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/old-classroom-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/old-classroom-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/old-classroom-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/old-classroom.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> 1920s Boarding School. Photo source: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/19492210863411834/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>. </div> <p>Unfortunately, instructionism is not just a thing of the past. It is likely that you yourself have experienced it firsthand: It’s a paradigm in which there’s a person with expertise (usually a teacher) whose role it is to pass on the “things” that they are an expert in. These “things” are <em>facts</em> (truths about the world; e.g., “<a href="" target="_blank">Bern</a> is the capital of Switzerland”) and <em>problem-solving procedures</em> useful to navigating the world (e.g. multiplication and division). According to this framework, students come to school with “empty minds”. These empty minds are to be filled up with said facts and procedures, so that students can go on and perform their later jobs. The more of these facts and procedures a person knows, the more “educated” they are, and how much they know is determined by <em>testing</em> them on their knowledge. The standard curriculum starts out with the easier facts and procedures and then progresses to more complex ones as time goes on. However, what’s considered complex is always up to the experts, not the students —this means that the experts set the order, pace, and content of what is taught.</p> <p>There is a lot to unpack here regarding why instructionism fails to properly facilitate learning in today’s world— people have written entire books on this. But one very important component is that 21st century jobs require <em>deep conceptual understanding</em>, not just plain “knowledge” of facts and procedures:</p> <blockquote> Educated graduates need a deep conceptual understanding of complex concepts and the ability to work with them creatively to generate new ideas, new theories, new products, and new knowledge. They need to be able to critically evaluate what they read, to be able to express themselves clearly both verbally and in writing, and to be able to understand scientific and mathematical thinking. They need to learn integrated and usable knowledge, rather than the sets of compartmentalized and decontextualized facts emphasized by instructionism. (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-the-learning-sciences/2E4224681267E61DBCE9B27630ED17BA" target="_blank">Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences</a>, p. 38). </blockquote> <p>A simple example of this, which I’m sure everyone can relate to, are formulas in mathematics. Let’s take the binomial theorem from secondary school algebra: You learn that \((a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2\) and exam questions will require you to apply this formula. However, in the exam, you are then asked to factor \(z^2+k^2+2kz\) – suddenly the order of the terms is different, the letters are too, and instead of expanding you are now factoring, i.e. “going the other way”. Knowing the <em>fact</em> of the binomial theorem and the <em>procedure</em> of expanding will not be enough, although you may have been encouraged to learn it this way — you’ll also need to understand <em>why and how</em> the theorem is to be modified to fit this novel context. And it is exactly that which requires deep conceptual understanding.</p> <p>So, how can deep conceptual understanding be taught, or rather, facilitated? This question is not necessarily a novel one. In fact, it brings us to the second half of the 20th century.</p> <h2>How else can learning and teaching be viewed and done?</h2> <p>The following paragraphs will only focus on a few select figures and ideas that were important to the development of the field, more specifically to formal learning (e.g. school contexts). There are many more worth mentioning, but for now, I’d like to focus on just the concept of <em>scaffolding</em> and two researchers named Vygotsky and Piaget:</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky" target="_blank">Lev Vygotsky</a> introduced the very interesting notion of the <em>zone of proximal development</em> (ZPD). The idea behind the ZPD is that there are tasks outside of each student’s “zone” of tasks they can do fully on their own, but that those out-of-reach tasks can be reached with appropriate help. Once the student receives said help, he learns, expands his zone and advances to the next task. “By actively participating in working through these more complex tasks, children learn from the experience and go beyond what they can accomplish alone.” (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-the-learning-sciences/2E4224681267E61DBCE9B27630ED17BA" target="_blank">Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences</a>, p. 82)</p> <p><em>Scaffolding</em> is another conception of supporting a person’s learning process. You could view it as giving hints or prompts that are just enough for someone to keep making progress towards a goal, but still letting them construct the necessary knowledge to eventually reach it all by themselves. An example of this is a child that can’t tell where the next puzzle piece goes: Instead of showing or telling it where to put the piece, you could instead ask a question such as: “When you look at the shape of that puzzle piece, is there any gap in the puzzle that looks similar to it?”. The child thus still has to make sense of the shape, scan the puzzle, and recognize potential matches all by itself.</p> <p>Although this technique may seem obvious, and may even be put to use often in parenting, it is not all that common in classrooms. One reason for that may be the usual teacher-student ratio. Fortunately, scaffolding does <em>not</em> necessarily require a physical tutor for each child — it can for example also be done by adding prompts and tips to learning software or book exercises!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/piaget-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/piaget-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/piaget-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/piaget.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Jean Piaget, 1968.

One of the ideas of his I especially like is that <em>new ideas always emerge from old ones</em>, also implying that children are not an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, but rather that they come with preconceptions and ideas about the world. For example, there is much research on how <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2011/infant-cognition-0527" target="_blank">infants have an understanding of the basic rules of the physical world</a>, which is of course in direct contradiction to the hypotheses of instructionism. Piaget’s ideas also have many more implications, but instead of going into the nuances and details of all of them, I’d like to end this text by picking up on the one connected question that I feel is most important here:</p> <h2>How can these insights be applied?</h2> <p>First of all, if we had the definitive answer to that, you would probably already know about it, and the world would look very, very different. However, despite the academic field of learning sciences still being in its youth (it is only roughly 30 years old!), it has already produced a good amount of promising ideas which are either already in place or being tested. Here’s a few of them:</p> <ul> <li>Focusing on improving instructional techniques is not enough — students have to also actively engage in their own learning. Thus, students’ learning processes should also be subject of research, and this demands the use of both quantitative and qualitative research methods</li> <li>Students reflecting on their developing knowledge and expressing that in some form is crucial to their learning; this can be done in spoken conversation, written form, illustration, or by creating any kind of artifact</li> <li>Facts and procedures are important, but the aim is to make their application to the real world and interrelatedness obvious. The <em>learning environment</em> is essential in achieving this, and <em>project-based learning</em> leverages exactly that: Groups of students start with an unsolved question or problem, share and discuss ideas, draw from scientific practices and apply them to the matter, utilize the technologies available for hints when stuck (scaffolding), share the final solution with the rest of the class, and reflect on the problem-solving process in preparation for the next “run”</li> <li>Computers provide a great way of representing abstract knowledge in concrete form, and they also allow for the articulation of developing knowledge as well as sharing and combining of ideas with peers</li> </ul> <p>As the textbook definition at the very beginning mentioned, people working and researching in the learning sciences come from many different backgrounds, ranging from computer science all the way to design studies. But good ideas don’t just come from “learning experts” — I have seen an example of a <a href="https://www.colormephd.org/" target="_blank">brilliant educational coloring book developed by a chemical engineering researcher</a>! I’d say the field’s advances are based on the many unique insights that people bring with them, even if it’s just their own experiences with the schooling system. You can have a look at the <a href="https://www.isls.org/" target="_blank">International Society of Learning Sciences</a> in case you’re interested in looking into the field some more.</p> <p>I said that this was the final note, but as you probably can tell, what this <em>actually</em> does is open up many more questions about the present and future of learning and teaching, not just in schools but also in informal settings. Even just the book I quoted at various points, the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-the-learning-sciences/2E4224681267E61DBCE9B27630ED17BA" target="_blank">Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences</a>, has 800 pages covering many more angles and recommendations.</p> <p>As I myself learn more about learning (or even learning about learning about learning?), I will continue to cover some of it in writing, much in the spirit of <em>expressing one’s reflection process</em>. So until next time, and thanks for reading!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Personal"/><category term="LearningSciences"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not too long ago, probably sometime around summer last year, I first came across the term “Learning Sciences”.

Some of the topics that occupied me in particular during the past twelve months were (lifelong) learning, teaching, creativity, and education as a whole. This text ended up being somewhat long, but as each of the quotes pretty much speaks for itself, feel free to skip any part!</p> <h2>Lifelong Kindergarten</h2> <p>To start off with my most recent read, <em><a href="http://lifelongkindergarten.net/" target="_blank">Lifelong Kindergarten</a></em> is both <b>a book</b> written by MIT professor <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/mres/overview/" target="_blank">Mitchel Resnick</a> as well as the name of his research group that makes part of the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/lifelong-kindergarten/overview/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>. While Resnick’s group specializes in learning research as whole, it places emphasis on the use of media and technology in enhancing creative learning experiences. Judging from one of the pictures I found, it must be rather fun to be part of the <em>Lifelong Kindergarten</em>:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/resnick-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/resnick-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/resnick-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/resnick.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Mitchel Resnick and… legos.

Here’s one from the first chapters:</p> <blockquote> With ploughs we can cultivate, with telescopes we can see, with engines we can travel, far beyond the limits of our unassisted bodies. <b>But tools do more than extend our bodies: they expand our minds. Technology facilitates ideas that might otherwise be inconceivable.</b> </blockquote> <p>The discussion around whether infinite growth — with technology playing its part — ultimately does more harm than good is an important one. However, on an individual level, the tools and scientific knowledge ranging from a simple hammer all the way to sophisticated computers certainly enhance our environment and daily lives. They make the pursuit of ideas easier and potentially further reaching, especially when thinking of modern technology such as the internet.</p> <p>In regards to learning, you could also consider the process of creating new technology to be a learning experience in itself! And that’s exactly where creativity and creative learning come into play:</p> <blockquote> The <b>Creative Learning Spiral</b> is the engine of creative thinking. As kindergarten children go through the spiral, they develop and refine their abilities as creative thinkers. They learn to develop their own ideas, try them out, experiment with alternatives, get input from others, and generate new ideas based on their experiences. Unfortunately, after kindergarten, most schools shift away from the Creative Learning Spiral. Students spend much of their time sitting at desks, filling out worksheets, and listening to lectures — whether from a teacher in the classroom or a video on the computer. <b>Too often, schools focus on delivering instruction and information rather than supporting students in the creative learning process.</b> </blockquote> <p>The <em>Creative Learning Spiral</em>, another of Resnick’s concepts, encompasses the building blocks <em>imagine, create, play, share and reflect</em> (for an extensive description of what each entails, see the corresponding, very concise 6-page paper available <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/kindergarten-learning-approach.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/spiral-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/spiral-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/spiral-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/spiral.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Creative Learning Spiral.

In connection to the work of the <em>Lifelong Kindergarten</em> group, I would love to see things like <b><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a></b> used more often in schools and (online) classrooms. Looking at the research in the fields of educational and learning sciences (some of which is mentioned in my previous article, <a href="https://adaniabutto.medium.com/game-based-learning-and-21st-century-skills-c8763569d44e" target="_blank">Game-Based Learning And 21st Century Skills</a>), there really is only little if not no reason for many of the educational systems to hold on to their traditional ways of going about teaching and learning.</p> <p>On a similar note, other approaches naturally come with their own challenges:</p> <blockquote> In her studies, Karen [<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/kbrennan" target="_blank">Karen Brennan, Harvard University</a>] found that there are problems with both too much structure and too little structure. With too much structure, young people can’t work on what they want to work on. With too little structure, many aren’t able to come up with ideas or follow through on ideas. Karen rejects the idea that structure and agency should be seen in opposition to each other. She argues for the “best of both worlds,” proposing learning environments that “employ structure in a way that amplifies learner agency.” </blockquote> <p>Reflecting back on my own (ongoing) experience with self-assigned learning on platforms such as <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>, it is relatively easy for a lack of structure to emerge in such environments. I imagine that with COVID, this has been one of the main challenges for many students throughout all stages of education, and might just continue to be so for the coming years. Resnick suggests and employs some interesting solutions in his book, such as <a href="https://theclubhousenetwork.org/" target="_blank">Computer Clubhouses</a>. While such an approach to STEM education might translate relatively well to an online setting, non-STEM subjects seem to present more of a challenge.</p> <p>Nonetheless, many institutions and businesses are putting much thought and effort towards these issues (as solving them is also financially rewarding, as can be seen on the example of <em>Zoom</em>). If you’re interested in reading more on that, I have mentioned other promising examples of educational software and tools in an earlier text of mine, <em><a href="https://adaniabutto.medium.com/walking-a-tightrope-a-closer-look-at-microsoft-education-dc3bdfd9db92" target="_blank">Walking a Tightrope: A closer look at Microsoft Education</a></em>.</p> <h2>“Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!”</h2> <p>The second book I’d like to mention and comment on is <em>“Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!”</em>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a> describes some of his memories and other parts of his biography. The Nobel Prize-winning professor of Physics was well known for his engaging and ‘unusual’ way of teaching and explaining complex topic––part of his legacy are the highly praised <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics" target="_blank">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a></em> as well as the very popular <em><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/artssciences-advising/resource-library/life-skills/the-feynman-technique-in-academic-coaching" target="_blank">Feynman Technique</a></em>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/feynman-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/feynman-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/feynman-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/feynman.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Richard Feynman holding a lecture in 1959. Picture source: <a href="https://speakola.com/ideas/richard-feynman-nanotechnology-lecture-1959" target="_blank">Speakola</a>. </div> <blockquote> … After the lecture, I talked to a student: “You take all those notes — what do you do with them?” “Oh, we study them,” he says. “We’ll have an exam.” “What will the exam be like?” “Very easy. I can tell you now one of the questions.” He looks at his notebook and says, “‘When are two bodies equivalent?’ And the answer is, ‘Two bodies are considered equivalent if equal torques will produce equal acceleration.’ ” <b>So, you see, they could pass the examinations, and “learn” all this stuff, and not know anything at all, except what they had memorized.</b> </blockquote> <p>Note that this particular interaction took place sometime around the early 1950s (!), when Feynman was on a sabbatical in Brazil teaching at the <em>Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas</em>. But I believe that this way of learning is still very much present today, even all the way up in higher education. In fact––and this is not much of a controversial take, as far as I’m concerned––, the way exams are structured in many educational systems, rote learning is often <em>encouraged</em>. Thus, my personal takeaway is to even more so challenge my own ‘understanding’ in ways similar to what Feynman suggested. More importantly, this approach does not have to be exclusive to the school context, but may also include questions such as: Why are days ‘shorter’ during winter than summer? What does exponential growth mean in the context of a pandemic? It is surprising how good we can be at fooling ourselves into thinking that we <em>understand</em> such things, even at the most basic level!</p> <p>And lastly, to end on the note of (not) fooling yourself:</p> <blockquote> <b>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.</b> So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that. I would like to add something that’s not essential to the science, but something I kind of believe, which is that you should not fool the layman when you’re talking as a scientist. </blockquote> <p>Although not everyone is a scientist, many people go on to be an expert in some way or form. It can be very easy to settle for one specific perspective or line of argument once you feel you’ve put sufficient thought, studying, and/or research into something. But even if so, if not all the more, there is value in continuously challenging one’s own ‘understanding’, just like Feynman describes. It is also for this reason that I plan to keep doing these writings, occasionally coming back to topics I had already visited at an earlier point, and to hopefully keep discovering new insights by doing just that!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="HigherEducation"/><category term="LearningSciences"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[To conclude the year 2020, I put together quotes from two of the books I very much enjoyed reading, complementing them with a few personal comments.

Merit-based scholarships seem to be rather unheard of, and so they are only rarely actively promoted (or perhaps just in specific circles). And yet, at the very latest as one enters university, I would argue scholarships become one of the most useful and desirable things all around, especially if you plan to go on exchange abroad.</p> <p>Thus — mostly out of self-interest —, I took the time to research some of the most well-established merit-based scholarships attainable for Swiss students. I want to note that this text is mostly a byproduct of having written along in said research process. It is by no means an exhaustive list or complete guide, and if you’re interested in applying to scholarships yourself, you should definitely do your own research. Furthermore, since scholarships and grants for PhD students and post-docs are a tad different, the contents of this text may not be useful if you fall into said category. However, there is one thing that applies to anyone applying for a scholarship, no matter the career stage: There’s a tremendous amount of paperwork coming your way. Consider yourself warned!</p> <h2>What scholarships are there?</h2> <p>For students that are also Swiss citizens or residents, <a href="https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/service/scholarships-for-study-abroad/government-scholarships/scholarship-offers" target="_blank">swissuniversities</a> provides a decent first overview of national and international scholarships awarded by various governments and government bodies. They list a total of 30+ countries that offer study abroad with official financial aid, ranging from Australia to China all the way to Russia and the USA.</p> <p>But while there are scholarships and grants for pretty much any field of study and most domains of “talent”, there are many nuances to what each individual scholarship actually entails:</p> <blockquote> The type, duration and amount of a scholarship varies greatly from country to country. Scholarships are awarded for studies, research, specialisations, teaching, art or language courses; the duration can last from a few weeks to several years. Normally, a government scholarship covers the cost of living and studying in the host country. Some countries, however, only award partial scholarships; in such cases, the scholarship recipient is personally responsible for covering the remaining costs. (Quote from swissuniversities) </blockquote> <p>So, in certain cases, you may actually have to apply to multiple scholarships if you don’t have any funds of your own. Fortunately, it’s not only governments that offer financial support! There are also independent foundations such as the <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.ch/" target="_blank">Schweizer Studienstiftung</a>, even some heritage-based ones (e.g. the <a href="https://blatterstiftung.ch/" target="_blank">Charles E. Blatter Stiftung</a>). Interestingly enough, the independent kind quite often awards scholarships based on place of birth and/or residence or other very specific criteria, e.g. religious affiliation. You can find an official list of all acknowledged Swiss (study-related) foundations <a href="https://www.edi.admin.ch/edi/de/home/fachstellen/eidgenoessische-stiftungsaufsicht/stiftungsverzeichnis.exturl.html/aHR0cHM6Ly9lc3YuZGVpbW9zLmNoL0hvbWUvUmVzdWx0cw==.html?Keyword=studium&amp;TopicId=&amp;Lang=de" target="_blank">here</a> and other useful links <a href="https://www.swissuniversities.ch/services/stipendien-ausland/weitere-informationen/stiftungen/foerderung" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/latvia/de/home/dienstleistungen/stipendien.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <h2>What does the application process look like, roughly?</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/writing-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/writing-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/writing-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/writing.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>When applying to scholarships, especially international ones, there are generally the following steps:</p> <ol> <li><b>You check whether you meet the eligibility criteria.</b> Those often include aspects like age, citizenship, (family) income, language proficiency, grade point average, amount of study semesters completed, amount of study semesters left to complete, and not currently receiving any other scholarships or financial support. As I mentioned right before, you may also have to live in a certain canton or city or have other affiliations. This information can always be found online.</li> <li><b>You send in your application with all the required documents.</b> In 99% of cases, this includes your <em>CV</em>, <em>Transcript of Records</em> (an overview of all your courses and grades), a <em>Personal Statement</em> (why you should be awarded the scholarship and what you intend to do with it), an <em>essay</em> of some sorts, <em>proof of meeting the eligibility criteria</em> (e.g., language diplomas, financial records), and sometimes also <em>a study and budget plan</em>, as well as multiple <em>Letters of Recommendation</em> (LoR). LoRs often have to be from professors or other people of “status”, and not only is getting multiple of them not easy, they should also be full of praise. Furthermore, you may have to get <a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/germany/de/home/dienstleistungen/beglaubigung.html" target="_blank">certified copies of your documents</a> if they’re required to be in English or any other language. Besides it being a lot of effort to collect all these documents, it most often also costs quite a bit of money.</li> <li><b>Your application gets reviewed and you are (maybe) invited to a personal interview.</b> The interview is usually held by the board of the respective foundation/scholarship or their representatives. As far as I understand, questions posed in these interviews revolve around your motivations, qualifications and plans. As I don’t have any personal experience with this, you can find a lot of information and tips on this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fulbright+interview" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</li> <li>Provided you pass the interview, what follows is the <b>final confirmation</b> that you were accepted. But then comes <b>information meetings and more paperwork</b>. The responsible people tell you what your next steps should be, and you go on to prepare for whatever your destination is. You may even have to attend another interview at the VISA office or apply for a spot at your desired university, possibly taking more tests (e.g. the GRE for US universities).</li> <li><b>You’re done!</b> Well, at least for the time being. Many scholarships also demand that you’re actively and consistently engaged in the network and community, for example taking part in meetings and events and writing essays or giving talks on your experience. But if you’ve come this far, chances are that you don’t mind doing those :-)</li> </ol> <p>You’ll find the above steps in most if not all scholarship application processes, no matter if you’re applying for the Schweizer Studienstiftung or some international scholarship. But as I previously mentioned, do keep in mind that certain scholarships come with very unique requirements, which is why starting early and reading through things yourself is crucial!</p> <p>Lastly, I’d like to touch on one special case:</p> <h2>The Fulbright Scholarship</h2> <p>Now that Donald Trump has left office, one can finally think about going to the USA again! And one of the best ways of doing so is through the <a href="" target="_blank">Fulbright scholarship</a>––a very prestigious accolade. It is specifically aimed at exchange in study and research between the US and other nations and does not fund anything other than that.</p> <p>The relevant program for (pre-PhD) Swiss students is the <em>Fulbright Foreign Student Program</em>. You’ll find more extensive information on it and other options <a href="https://ch.usembassy.gov/education-culture/fulbright/" target="_blank">here</a>, but let me give you a quick summary:</p> <p><b>Fulbright Foreign Student Program</b></p> <blockquote> If you want to pursue: a Master’s or Ph.D. degree; non-degree coursework; or Ph.D. research. The Grants are four to ten months in length and not renewable. They are to be used toward the cost of tuition and other academic expenses. In general, a grant for one academic year is about $20,000. </blockquote> <p>A general heads-up: The Fulbright Scholarship application window has <em>one</em> deadline per year (sometime in August), and each application cycle is for the award of the scholarship in the <em>following</em> year. In other words, if you apply in summer of 2021, you’re effectively applying for the scholarship starting in autumn of 2022. Taking into account that you have to gather all of the required documents well before that, you should probably start planning <em>1.5 to two years in advance</em>. Fun, isn’t it?</p> <p>One of the program’s downsides is that you only have little power over which university you’ll eventually go to (unless the universities approach you). <a href="https://www.swissuniversities.ch/service/stipendien-ausland/grants-for-the-usa/fulbright-student-grants" target="_blank">With the support of the Institute of International Education (IIE)</a>, you will apply to four or five US universities, going through the regular application process just like all the US students (AKA even more paperwork). As everyone knows, getting into some of the “better” schools in the US is extremely competitive. It is said that the prestige of the scholarship does help with your chances, though.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/mit-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/mit-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/mit-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mit.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I also wanted to cover a second special case, namely going on exchange for study and research in England. It is fascinating to me how institutions like Cambridge and Oxford basically defy the entire higher education system with some of their structures and systems. But I’ll leave that for next time and end with some final summarizing thoughts instead.</p> <h2>What does one do with all that information?</h2> <p>In conclusion, I would say that one of the biggest hurdles in applying to scholarships is the administrative side. You have to see how you get to the relevant information yourself (at least initially), you have to think far ahead, you need to be able to manage and keep track of many things, and you have to be ready to hand in piles of documents on a regular basis, all without a guarantee that it will pay off.</p> <p>Now, of course this isn’t me criticizing the scholarships themselves––without them, many would not even be able to study let alone leave their country. As some of them award very large sums of money, there <em>should</em> be certain barriers and hurdles. This is just to say that you should keep all these points in mind when deciding to take on all that work.</p> <p>On the upside, the process of applying for single exchange semesters, for example by support of SEMP (the Swiss equivalent of ERASMUS), is much more straightforward, although not to be underestimated either. I may cover that in a later text.</p> <p>Once more, I recommend starting the process by going through the webpage of <a href="https://www.swissuniversities.ch/service/stipendien-ausland/regierungsstipendien" target="_blank">swissuniversities</a>. Besides that, YouTube and Google are your friend when looking for personal tips coming directly from scholarship recipients!</p> <hr/> <p><em>I was fortunate enough to be selected as a principal candidate for the Fulbright Scholarship in September 2021.

Merit-based scholarships seem to be rather unheard of, and so they are only rarely actively promoted (or perhaps just in specific circles).

How could it be that games teach us things in an effective manner? After all, most of the commonly known ones are designed for entertainment. Furthermore, digital games are often made so that the story takes place in a fictional world nothing like ours, take <em>Super Mario</em> for example. However, that’s not exactly what researchers mean when they speak of GBL. Let’s have a look at the definition(s) first.</p> <h2>What exactly is Game-Based Learning (GBL)?</h2> <p>So, what falls under GBL? According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.023" target="_blank">Qian and Clark (2016)</a>, the term is defined as <b>an environment where both the game content and game play induce skill and knowledge acquisition</b>. This means that the activities taking place as part of the game involve <b>problem solving as well as <b>challenges</b> that give the player some sense of achievement once completed. Now this is obviously a very broad definition.</b></p> <p>If the first thing that came to your mind is something like the “ladders game” or card games, then you’re absolutely right—these do in fact also count. It’s just that the recent focus of GBL research has been set on <em>digital</em> game-based learning, although incorporating digital technologies is not a must per se. You can find some examples of GBL-oriented video games on <a href="https://education.mit.edu/project-type/games/" target="_blank">MIT’s Teacher Education Program website</a>.</p> <p>Other terms that one might come across within the field are <em>Serious Games</em> (SG), <em>Gamification</em> or <em>Playful Learning</em>. There seems to be an ongoing discussion on how to define and separate those, but here are some basic outlines I found:</p> <ul> <li><em>Gamification</em> encompasses extracting elements and structures from games and applying them to more “serious” environments like companies, schools or households</li> <li><em>Playful Learning</em> does not necessarily utilize games for learning, but rather emphasizes some of the playful components of learning</li> <li><em>Serious Games</em> are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game target="_blank"&gt;“designed for purposes other than pure entertainment”&lt;/a&gt; and might for example help with the training of doctors. The term also includes simulations: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.10.040" target="_blank">Lamb et al. (2018)</a> mention that “Call of Duty, if used to train military personal in room clearing techniques, could be considered an example of a Serious Game”</li> </ul> <p>You could technically say that GBL is an umbrella term for all of the above, but not everybody in the research community seems to agree with that. For the sake of this story, we’ll go with this (simplified) definition though. Now let’s have a look at the research that has been done so far!</p> <h2>What does the Research say about the Effectiveness of GBL?</h2> <p>As with all other research that deals with such questions, there are no definitive answers — nevertheless, there are interesting findings that are worth discussing. In a recent meta-analysis by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.023" target="_blank">Qian and Clark (2016)</a>, 29 relevant studies published between 2010 and 2014 were investigated. The authors focused on <b>GBL in relation to 21st century skills</b> (a wide range of skills including but not limited to critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, communication as well as media and technology skills), and provide us with the following takeaways:</p> <ul> <li><b>While 21st century skills by themselves are only a small subfield of GBL research, most of the 29 papers focused on the development of critical thinking skills</b>. Only few investigated creativity and collaboration, and only one single study took a closer look at communication skills</li> <li><b>Participants covered a wide range of ages</b>, from K5 (5 to 11 years old) up to graduate level students, which is fantastic — in comparison, action video game research focuses almost entirely on young adults</li> <li><b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/constructivism" target="_blank">Constructivism</a> was the learning theory that was most often referred to</b> by studies, however, across the field as a whole, many studies seem to fail to address learning theories in the theoretical foundation of their research (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.05.003" target="_blank">Wu et al., 2012</a>). This might have something to do with the outcomes of said research</li> <li><b>Fewer than half of the studies reported effect sizes</b>, although most (85%) reported significant effects. This is unfortunate as it limits the conclusions that can be drawn from their results</li> <li>The results of the studies that found significant effects seemed to mostly depend on game design, while <b>“game design elements proven successful in the entertainment game industry are most likely to lead to effective learning“</b>. Examples of such critical elements would be <em>Competition</em>, <em>Collaboration</em> and <em>Exploration &amp; Discovery</em>, which are very prevalent in non-educational video games</li> <li>In connection to that last point, <b>design-based games seemed to work best in improving 21st century skills</b>, despite them not having educational goals!</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusions and Outlook</h2> <p>The authors of the cited meta-analysis state that <b>“a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students’ 21st century skill development”</b>. One thing to keep in mind is that the investigated studies are already six to ten years old, and as all technological fields move very rapidly, reviews of more recent studies are needed!</p> <p>While some improvements in 21st century skills can evidently be achieved via GBL (e.g. critical thinking), there’s still a lack of research when it comes to some other ones (e.g.communication and creativity). However, in the past, research on GBL has shown that educational games are positively linked to other learning outcomes such as cognitive ones (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.03.004" target="_blank">Connolly et al., 2012</a>). Thus, <b>the domain as a whole seems promising and current challenges mostly lie in the effective design of the educational games</b>. This requires new approaches to avoid ending up with the same drill and narrow academic focus in the gameplay that can (sometimes) be found in the classroom.</p> <p>I myself will have a closer look at some of the more successful educational games such as <a href="https://education.mit.edu/project/the-radix-endeavor/" target="_blank">MIT’s “The Radix Endeavor”</a> to try and figure out what sets it apart from others.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="LearningSciences"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game-Based Learning (GBL) is one of those things that kind of sound too good to be true.

Now this doesn’t necessarily mean that the creator can’t make profit or can’t use certain design techniques to capture people’s attention more effectively, but it is a balancing act that can quickly spiral out of control, which I thought <em>The Social Dilemma</em> illustrated quite well.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/socialdilemma-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/socialdilemma-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/socialdilemma-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/socialdilemma.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Picture Source: <a href="https://livewire.thewire.in/out-and-about/why-the-social-dilemma-wont-make-me-quit-social-media/" target="_blank">LiveWire</a> </div> <p>So, are there any examples that seem like they’re successfully doing this balancing act? Being a student myself, I have primarily been working with <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a>. The former is a tool used for online lectures as well as video/conference calls in general and has only recently come into play for me, together with COVID. The latter is primarily used for information exchange between educators and students (e.g. upload of lecture slides or updates regarding exams/homework) and has been in use since the beginning of my studies.</p> <p>As college and university students are expected to be well-organized and autonomous for the most part (rightfully so), the Zoom-and-Moodle-approach seems to be working well in most cases — it did in mine. As far as I can tell, students as well as educators have quickly adapted to blended and/or online learning, with the exception of some initial difficulties when it came to figuring out all the software/platform features (muting your microphone seems to be especially complicated).</p> <p>However, the needs and capabilities of people in higher education obviously differ from those of people in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school#Levels_of_education" target="_blank">primary and secondary education</a>, one simple example being that students at lower educational stages require much more guidance. This got me wondering, what solutions have we come up with for that specific group? One of the go-to tool and resource providers seems to be <a href="https://education.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank">Microsoft Education</a>, which is why I want to take a closer look at that today.</p> <h2>What does Microsoft Education entail?</h2> <p>Entering Microsoft Education’s website, there’s a paragraph that says: “A focused learning environment can be a challenge in hybrid learning. Microsoft Education is here to support multimedia experiences that keep educators, students, and families connected.”</p> <p>Looking through the navigation bar, there’s a wide range of options and offers, from training courses for educators (e.g., <a href="https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/resource/0c6e9c42" target="_blank">on special education and accessibility in remote learning</a>) to lesson plans for STEM (e.g., <a href="https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/hackingStem" target="_blank">project-based activities for remote learning</a>). I can’t speak on the exact content of these offers since I neither have access to them nor am I an educator myself. Instead, I conducted a quick search on empirical studies that pick up on Microsoft Education’s effectiveness, but it came back with no results. Taking into consideration that the COVID situation is still ongoing and such studies sometimes take years until they’re published, this isn’t exactly surprising.</p> <p>Fortunately, Microsoft Education has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/stories" target="_blank">case study section</a> on their own webpage, from which I was able to gather some (qualitative) insights:</p> <h2>Case studies and Feedback on Microsoft Education</h2> <p>There are dozens of case studies and reports available from schools all over the world. Many of them include interesting stories, so if you’ve got the time, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/stories" target="_blank">you should go have a look for yourself</a>! Here’s a rough outline of the feedback from a few select institutions of primary, secondary as well as higher education:</p> <ul> <li>Primary education institutions such as <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/783715-omnimundo-education-windows10-office365-surface-belgium-en" target="_blank">Omnimundo from Belgium</a> mention how OneNote and other apps like <a href="https://www.lifeliqe.com/" target="_blank">Lifeliqe</a> help students stay engaged. A <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/748341-ecole-elementaire-mont-tournier-edu-skype-en-france" target="_blank">primary school in France</a> mentions having used tools like <a href="https://education.skype.com/" target="_blank">Skype Mystère</a> (description below) with success.</li> </ul> <blockquote> Skype Mystére is a game that allows kids to learn about art, culture, the environment and geography and sciences. The way it works is that a game is played between two different classes, who strive to reach a simple, common goal: each class must guess the geographical location of the other by asking the class’ members questions. A good practice for this game is to assign a specific role (whether the role be that of a detective, thinker, cartographer, etc.) to each student. There is an element in the game’s difficulty in that the questions asked must always be closed, meaning that they can only be appropriately answered with ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ </blockquote> <ul> <li>One implementation that is especially remarkable to me is the usage of the <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft Education Edition</a> (game-based learning!) in 8 <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/748348-thomas-pagotto-albacraft-minecraft-education-france-en" target="_blank">primary school classes in France</a> to digitally reproduce an archaeological site. The project got teachers as well as students very excited. Here’s the result:</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/minecraft-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/minecraft-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/minecraft-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/minecraft.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A picture of the archaelogical site in Minecraft.

Some of them voice rather steep learning curves in getting to know all the features.</li> <li>The use of some tools in Higher Education, such as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a> in research at <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/792956-leiden-university-education-azure-netherlands-en" target="_blank">Leiden University</a> in the Netherlands and <em>Microsoft Teams</em> in teaching, e.g. at <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/821344-imperial" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>, UK, has resulted in positive feedback on usability and effectiveness</li> </ul> <p>I’ll let you decide what to make of all that, considering that the case studies were conducted by Microsoft Education themselves. A remaining challenge seems to be the conduct of fair and effective online exams, which the reports have not touched on. Other obvious issues would be dependence on (stable) internet connection and financial barriers (what if the parents can’t afford to buy the needed devices?). On the upside, some of the schools state that they pay for the needed devices, at the very least when it comes to using them in the classroom.</p> <p>Overall, I gained a positive first impression of Microsoft Education. I’m looking forward to reading future (independent) quantitative studies, possibly looking at educational outcomes, effects on motivation, attention, creativity, problemsolving and other relevant aspects — the list is long. I also hope to get to test some of the mentioned applications and products myself, possibly by using them for my own studying.</p> <p>If you happen to have any thoughts on this matter, personal experience with Microsoft Research or links to relevant research, let me know! That’s all for today — thanks for reading, and until you next time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="LearningSciences"/><category term="Technology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve read my past two stories on Game-Based Learning and exciting projects at the intersection of video games, CS and education, then you’ve probably noticed that I’ve been on the lookout for positive examples of novel approaches to learning and teaching, especially those involving digital technology.]]></summary></entry></feed>
