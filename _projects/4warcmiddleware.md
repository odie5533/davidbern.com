        <a href="https://github.com/odie5533/WarcMiddleware">WarcMiddleware</a> is a library that lets users save mirror backups of websites to their computer. It is an addon for the Python web crawler Scrapy that saves web server transactions (requests and responses) into a Web ARChive (WARC) file (ISO 28500). The transactions can then be played back or viewed, similar to using Archive.org's WayBackMachine. The WARC format is a standard method of saving these transactions.
