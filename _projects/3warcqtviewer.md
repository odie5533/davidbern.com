        <a href="https://github.com/odie5533/WarcQtViewer">WarcQtViewer</a> is an application for viewing and managing .warc or .warc.gz files. It is written in Python, using PyQt to create a user interface and light web browser widget. It uses my WarcReplay library to create a proxy and lets you view and navigate the archived website files.
