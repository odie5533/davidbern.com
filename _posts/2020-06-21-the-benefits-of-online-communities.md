Online  communities have been a thing for a long time – however, not everyone  knows about them or makes use of them. As someone who found many friends  and learned a lot from such places, I’d like to shed some light on the  general benefits and experiences that can come with them.

What’s the first thing that came to your mind when  you read the words “online communities”? Maybe it was an image of a kid in a dark room sitting in front of his computer talking to his friends  on Discord, or maybe you envisioned some sort of fringy online forum  that’s all about illegal stuff. Whenever I hear the  word, I go with the first option (maybe minus the dark room). I tend to  think of it as a place that has the ability to bring people together  from all around the world, the only requirement being internet access.

To  give some context, I started being active in online communities when I  was about nine or ten years old. It started with me playing games like <a href="http://de.flyff.webzen.com/landing/" target="_blank">Fly for Fun</a>,  which – as an MMO – obviously heavily focused on the (multi)player  interaction and thus also the social aspect. As a consequence of that,  the website of that game came with a forum where players shared their  tips and tricks, asked questions and sometimes even cursed at the game  developers saying how terrible their game is but how they just can’t  stop playing it.

An  argument I had to deal with very often was how spending time on my  computer (most of that time was spent on online communities) is no  replacement for “real life” in general. I don’t think online communities  are meant as a replacement in the first place! However, that’s not  really what this text is about. What has got me thinking is the  potential that lies in online communities in terms of education and  meeting people. I have been part of many wonderful examples like <a href="https://www.elitepvpers.com/" target="_blank">Elitepvpers</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>  (although that last one isn’t always so wonderful) that taught me many  skills I would probably not have learned otherwise, e.g. basic  webdesign. To be able to make my point here, I’d like to widen the scope  and include <b>online learning platforms</b>, too, since communities tend to also play a crucial role in those.

So,  why is it that I think I wouldn’t have been able to learn certain  skills or meet certain people at school? There’s multiple reasons I can  think of:

First  of all, “on site” education, at the very least on a primary and  secondary school level, is predetermined. There’s not really much room  for individuality – if a kid feels like learning about Web Design,  there’s not (or rarely) just a teacher there waiting to teach him.  However, there’s <em>always</em> an online community/learning  platform waiting to teach a kid about Web Design, as long as he or she  goes looking for it! Also, individuality is how online communities are  built in the first place, as they focus on very specific interests,  which automatically means (more or less) in-depth content. There is an  argument to be made here that online communities are exclusive to people  with money, as internet access isn’t exactly free and some communities  even charge a membership fee. However, we’re currently counting 4.13  billion internet users (according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1145/internet-usage-worldwide/" target="_blank">Statista</a>) and that number is increasing every year. Furthermore, many great online communities/learning platforms like <a href="https://de.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> are <em>completely free</em>, and many others offer discounts for students, or low prices in general. I think that’s a decent start!

    </div>

Another  thing about online communities/learning platforms that I appreciate a  lot is how you get to decide your own pace and style of learning. Want  to speed up, slow down, rewind or skip that video about algebra? No  problem. Want to speed up, slow down, rewind or skip your teacher at  school? Well… that might work in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389860/" target="_blank">Click</a>,  but not in reality (and I do not recommend trying it). You get the  point. These two “worlds” have started to blend because of online  lectures/classes during COVID, as a lot of what’s taught is recorded and  made accessible <em>afterwards</em>, but that seems to be a very recent development.

The  last point I’d like to bring up is how – from my experience – online  communities help with finding friends. Since their default form of  communication usually is text or voicechat, only few people care about  looks, age or any other kind of superficial indicator. There are  exceptions to this, and there obviously also are dangers that come with  that kind of anonymity (which I won’t get into right now), but I see it  as a net positive overall. If one was to compare the way groups are  formed in “real life” to the way they’re formed online, I think it’s  fair to say that the latter is a tad more flexible and uncomplicated.  There may even be studies to be read in relation to that, but that’s for  a next time.

This  was a very short dive into what I consider to be (some of) the benefits  of online communities and learning platforms. Up until this day, I  profit from friends, knowledge and experiences I made thanks to them,  which is also why I still spend a lot of time online looking for more.

That’s all for now – until next time!
