A couple of weeks ago, I was first introduced to the existence of <em>Cyber Valley</em>. My initial guesses as to what it could be included a) a newly released video game or b) a TV series.

<em>Hint: Both of these guesses are wrong</em>  — if you haven’t googled it yet, see if you can get it right without  checking. I later looked into it some more, and here’s what I found:

<h2>What exactly is Cyber Valley?</h2>
<a href="https://cyber-valley.de/" target="_blank">Cyber Valley</a> is a research consortium, initiated in 2016 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Sch%C3%B6lkopf" target="_blank">Bernhard Schoelkopf</a>.  It is located in the region between Stuttgart and Tuebingen, Germany,  and has grown to be the biggest research cooperation in Europe within  the field of Artificial Intelligence. Its partners include “the state of  Baden-Württemberg, the Max Planck Society with the Max Planck Institute  for Intelligent Systems, the Universities of Stuttgart and Tübingen, as  well as Amazon, BMW AG, Daimler AG, IAV GmbH, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche  AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, and ZF Friedrichshafen AG … Moreover, Fraunhofer  Gesellschaft recently joined Cyber Valley as an associated partner.  Cyber Valley also receives support from the Christian Bürkert  Foundation, the Gips-Schüle Foundation, the Vector Foundation, and the  Carl Zeiss Foundation”, according to <a href="https://cyber-valley.de/about" target="_blank">its website</a>.

So far, ten research groups and professorships have been established, and the corresponding fields of research range from <em>Neuronal Intelligence</em> to <em>Locomotion in Somatic and Biorobotic Systems</em>.  I will not get into the details of what exactly these research groups  deal with (mostly because I don’t really understand most of it either),  but you can read more <a href="https://cyber-valley.de/research-groups" target="_blank">here</a> if you’re interested!

<h2>What’s the Goal of Cyber Valley?</h2>
According to their <a href="https://cyber-valley.de/en/faqs#what-is-the-purpose-of-cyber-valley" target="_blank">website</a>,  the goal is to research AI methods locally, while keeping in mind that  there are both positive and negative uses for such. They see it as  important that the project remains embedded in open society and that  there’s critical discussion around questions and issues. The  establishment of research groups as well as professorships and being  able to offer PhD programs for over a hundred doctoral students is  supposed to counteract the lack of experts in the field of AI.

Lastly,  they mention that Cyber Valley promotes startup-culture within science  so that findings from fundamental research can be applied swiftly. The  active exchange between industry research and fundamental research is  supposed to provide new impulses for both sides to create ideal  conditions for spinoffs.

<h2>What’s Next for Cyber Valley?</h2>
Based on what has been reported in an older <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/mittwochsportraet-der-computerfluesterer-1.4707687" target="_blank">newspaper article</a> of the <em>Sueddeutsche Zeitung</em>,  the german government wants to invest three billion Euros and establish  a total of 100 professorships by 2025. The prime minister of  Baden-Württemberg, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfried_Kretschmann" target="_blank">Winfried Kretschmann</a>,  said that “swiftness and excellence is what counts when it comes to  competing with big players like Silicon Valley or Shenzhen, and if  Berlin can’t do it, we will”.

What  I also found interesting is that the founder of Cyber Valley, Bernhard  Schoelkopf, stated that he also initiated the project to keep upcoming  scientists and researchers from leaving Europe for North America or  other locations, but also to attract people from the outside of Europe  to come and work here. According to him, young researchers should not  have to feel like there are no opportunities to work and/or research for  promising and excellent institutions in their home country respectively  on their continent.

As  you might have noticed on the list of partners of Cyber Valley, Amazon  is establishing an AI-Lab including 100 researchers and engineers until  2021. However, as you might already suspect, this has turned out to be a  controversial topic: Last year, protests have taken place locally  regarding the installment of an Amazon Lab. After some discussion within  the municipal council, Amazon has been given green light. I did a quick  google search to see whether there have been any other protests  recently, but most of the activity seems to have happened last year. The  radio silence might also be due to COVID, so we’ll see what comes next  in regards to that after the situation has gone back to a more normal  state.

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
Since Tuebingen is relatively close to Switzerland, I’m interested in seeing  how this affects my country, its adjacent regions as well as our  technical universities like ETH or EPFL in the near future in terms of  research. I find the keeping-researchers-within-Europe-point to be a  good and very important one.

The  protests regarding Amazon are not unexpected. I personally find ethical  questions and discussions revolving around AI very interesting and will  be closely following future events and talks. In my opinion, the fact  that such research is taking place locally is definitely a chance to  make a positive and meaningful contribution to what the application of  AI methods will look like in the future.

As always, thanks for reading, and see you next time!
